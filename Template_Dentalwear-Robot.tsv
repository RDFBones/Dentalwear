dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore	Dental attrition score	A categorical label denoting a specific dental attrition state.			Felix Engel	class	obo:OBI_0000963						
dentalwear:NoInformation	No information available	No information available (tooth not occluding, unerupted, antemortem or postmortem loss, etc.).	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:WearFacetsInvisible	Wear facets invisible or very small	Wear facets invisible or very small.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:WearFacetsLarge	Wear facets large, but large cusps still present and surface features very evident	"Wear facets large, but large cusps still present and surface features (crenulations, noncarious pits) very evident. It is
possible to have pinprick size dentine exposures or “dots” which should be ignored. This is a quadrant with much enamel."	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:AnyCuspInQuadrantRounded	Any cusp in the quadrant area is rounded	Any cusp in the quadrant area is rounded rather than being clearly defined as in 'Wear facets large, but large cusps still present and surface features very evident'. The cusp is becoming obliterated but is not yet worn flat.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:QuadrantWornFlatNoDentineExposure	Quadrant area is worn flat but there is no dentine exposure	Quadrant area is worn flat (horizontal) but there is no dentine exposure other than a possible pinprick sized “dot.”	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:UpToOneFourthDentineExposure	Dentine exposure one-fourth of quadrant or less.	Quadrant is flat, with dentine exposure one-fourth of quadrant or less. (Be careful not to confuse noncarious pits with dentine exposure.)	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:OverOneFourthDentineExposure	Dentine exposure more than one fourth of quadrant	Dentine exposure greater: more than one-fourth of quadrant area is involved, but there is still much enamel present. If the quadrant is visualized as having three “sides” (as in the diagram in Scott, 1979, Tab. 1) the dentine patch is still surrounded on all three “sides” by a ring of enamel.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnTwoSidesOfQuadrant	Enamel on only two “sides” of the quadrant	Enamel is found on only two “sides” of the quadrant.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnOneSideOfQadrantThickToMedium	Enamel on only one “side” of the quadrant, thick to medium	Enamel on only one “side” (usually outer rim) but the enamel is thick to medium on this edge.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnOneSideOfQadrantThin	Enamel on only one “side” of the quadrant, thin	Enamel on only one “side” as in 8, but the enamel is very thin - just a strip. Part of the “edge” may be worn through a t one or more places.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:DentineExposureComplete	Denine exposure complete	No enamel on any part of quadrant - dentine exposure complete. Wear is extended below the cervicoenamel junction into the root.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	named individual		dentalwear:DentalAttritionScore					
dentalwear:WearOfMolarsValueSpecification	Wear of molars value specification	A value specification that specifies the dental attrition stage observed with a molar tooth.	Scott, E. C. (1979). Dental Wear Scoring Technique. Am. J. Phys. Anthrop. 51, Tab. 1.		Felix Engel	class	obo:OBI_0001933		('has category label' exactly 1 ({dentalwear:NoInformation, dentalwear:WearFacetsInvisible, dentalwear:WearFacetsLarge, dentalwear:AnyCuspInQuadrantRounded, dentalwear:QuadrantWornFlatNoDentineExposure, dentalwear:UpToOneFourthDentineExposure, dentalwear:OverOneFourthDentineExposure, dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnTwoSidesOfQuadrant, dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnOneSideOfQadrantThickToMedium, dentalwear:EnamelOnlyOnOneSideOfQadrantThin, dentalwear:DentineExposureComplete}))				
dentalwear:WearOfMolarsLabelSorting	Sorting directive for a wear of molars label	A sorting specification about the position of a category label within the ordinal scale defined by a wear of molars value specification.
